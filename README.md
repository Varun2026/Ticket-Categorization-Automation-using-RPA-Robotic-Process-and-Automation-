# Ticket Categorization Automation using RPA (Robotic Process Automation)

## Overview

In today's fast-paced business environment, managing tickets effectively is vital to ensure quick resolutions and customer satisfaction. Manual ticket categorization can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays. This project, **Ticket Categorization Automation**, leverages **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** with **UiPath** to automate the categorization of incoming tickets based on the email content. The system identifies keywords like "Hardware," "Software," or "Network" in the subject line and categorizes the emails accordingly into separate Google Sheets for further processing. 

This solution reduces manual intervention, minimizes errors, and enhances response times, demonstrating how RPA can streamline workflows in ticket management systems. The project also provides a foundation for implementing similar automation systems across different industries.

## Features

- **Email Reading:** Retrieves unread emails using UiPathâ€™s "Get IMAP Mail Messages" activity.
- **Keyword Detection:** Scans email subject lines for predefined keywords ("Hardware," "Software," "Network").
- **Categorization:** Automatically sorts emails into specific categories and logs them in respective Google Sheets.
- **Error Reduction:** Minimizes human errors in ticket categorization and enhances workflow efficiency.
- **Time Efficiency:** Automates repetitive tasks, speeding up the ticket management process.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- **UiPath Studio** (installed on your machine)
- **Google Account** and **Google Sheets** access
- **IMAP Email Account** (for email fetching)
- **UiPath Google Activities** package (for Google Sheets integration)
